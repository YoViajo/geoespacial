Next, we can convert the shapefiles to GeoJSON with ogr2ogr:

ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" -lco COORDINATE_PRECISION=1 ne_110m_admin_0_countries.json ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp 

ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" -lco COORDINATE_PRECISION=2 ne_50m_admin_0_countries.json ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp

The important thing is that I'm only keeping one decimal (coordinate precision) for the 110m dataset, and two decimals for the 50m dataset, which is sufficient for my map scales. This will reduce the size of the GeoJSON files by more than half. The size of the 110m GeoJSON is now 207 kB and the 50m version is 1,897 kB. But we can do better.
